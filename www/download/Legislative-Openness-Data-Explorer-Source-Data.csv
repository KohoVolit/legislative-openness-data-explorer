Poland,Finland,Civil society,,Finland,Unicameral,,Parliament of Finland,Yes,,"Clear Language:  The government committed to writing law proposal in a more understandable language. This includes specifically having understandable titles and synopsis for the bills.  Opening the database of government law reform committees and other projects. The information about committees and other law reform projects by different ministries has been online, but now the database is being opened up and should contain an open data api.  Clear process descriptions - this commitment states that the government will publish clear process descriptions that help the public understand workflow charts of law reform processes.  Increasing participation in law preparation - this commitment states, that the instructions that civil servant preparing new laws in the ministries will be amended. They should publicise alternative solutions and background information in early stages of law preparation. They should also use more and different ways to consult the public on the issues in an early stage. The latter part is vague on the commitment level.

The Chamber will host another one, now focusing Gender policies.   Further information:  www.camara.gov.br/Hackathon2014  2) Hacker Laboratory   After the fruitful Hackathon, the Hacker Laboratory was created to meet the demand of the activists for a permanent space of collaboration with the Hacker and developers communities. Since its inception in January 2014, the Hacker Lab has served as:  • An environment to promote discussions, interactions and collaborative development between parliamentarians, hackers, civil servants and citizens in general to create innovative projects and applications on citizenship, focusing on transparency and participation, through the management of public data. A physical  space where hackers and any citizen who want to develop projects of citizenship can work with internet access and public data within the Chamber. There is also the possibility of online broadcasting.    • The Hacker Lab is also responsible for managing the e-Democracy web-portal for social participation in the legislative process.

Chile,Chile,Parliament,,Chile,Bicameral,,Senate,Yes,,"El primer Plan de Trabajo de Parlamento Abierto para Chile se centra en tres de las líneas de trabajo de la Alianza de Gobierno Abierto: mejorar los servicios públicos, incrementar la integridad pública y perfeccionar la responsabilidad institucional del Congreso Nacional.   Parlamento Abierto para mejorar los servicios públicos.-  1.  El Congreso de Chile reconoce la importancia de la tecnología para informar a los ciudadanos respecto de su trabajo y rendir cuentas de su labor. Para facilitar el acceso a la información se contemplan las siguientes iniciativas: 1.1.	Incorporar el proceso de solicitud de información pública al Portal de Transparencia del Estado, que es común a todos los organismos públicos, de manera que no sea necesario utilizar cada sitio institucional. 1.2.	Homologar los mecanismos por los cuales los ciudadanos pueden solicitar información pública al Congreso Nacional y a su Biblioteca  a fin de emplear un mecanismo similar. 1.3.	Organizar de manera similar el contenido de los sitios electrónicos institucionales del Senado, la Cámara de Diputados y la Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional, en lo que se refiere a transparencia y rendición de cuentas, para facilitar el acceso ciudadano.  1.4.	Publicar un sitio electrónico común de Transparencia del Congreso Nacional para mostrar la información, documentación y actividades de organismos dedicados a la transparencia parlamentaria y en la que exista participación conjunta del Senado y de la Cámara de Diputados. Parlamento Abierto para incrementar la integridad pública.   2. El Congreso de Chile postula la necesidad de mejorar la percepción pública sobre los estándares de conducta de sus integrantes y entiende que, para ello, es preciso perfeccionar los mecanismos que las regulan y dar claridad sobre el ámbito de aplicación de las normas respectivas. Las iniciativas que se están llevando a cabo son las siguientes: 2.1. Aprobar, previa consulta pública, los reglamentos que debe dictar cada Cámara, de conformidad a la ley que regula el lobby y las gestiones que representen intereses particulares antes las autoridades y funcionarios.  2.2 Crear una unidad de apoyo interno en cada Cámara con el fin de prestar ayuda a los congresistas para llenar adecuadamente las declaraciones patrimoniales y de intereses, incluyendo los mandatos de administración de activos (fideicomiso), así como para ajustarse a las obligaciones previstas en la ley que regula el lobby y las gestiones que representen intereses particulares. Parlamento Abierto para incrementar la responsabilidad institucional.  3.  El Congreso Nacional estima conveniente establecer una política institucional que dé continuidad a los esfuerzos que desarrolle en temas de transparencia y probidad. Por ello considera la realización de las siguientes iniciativas:  3.1 Efectuar, en conjunto con el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) un estudio a mediano plazo para analizar, en conjunto con la sociedad civil el marco normativo sobre ética, transparencia y probidad en la gestión del Congreso Nacional.  3.2 Realizar asimismo, en conjunto  con el PNUD, un diagnóstico sobre los mecanismos de consulta y participación de la ciudadanía en las discusiones de ambas Cámaras con el objetivo de identificar prácticas, evaluarlas y elaborar una propuesta para fortalecer la participación en las distintas etapas del proceso legislativo.  3.3 Promover el desarrollo de iniciativas que fomenten la rendición de cuentas participativas de modo regular, para lo cual el Grupo Bicameral de Transparencia realizará un ejercicio piloto de cuenta pública en 2015 en el marco del convenio con el PNUD.   4. Informes periódicos  El Plan de Acción se someterá a las reglas generales de la Alianza de Gobierno Abierto, en cuanto a informes de avance y reformulaciones que correspondan,  y a un proceso “peer to peer” para evaluar su implementación.    ",Yes,,No,,Yes,,"Avances en la política institucional de transparencia  1.

Aplicación de la reforma constitucional que declaró públicos los actos y resoluciones de los órganos del Estado, así como sus fundamentos y los procedimientos que utilicen.   3. Inclusión en la Ley sobre Acceso a la Información Pública (Ley de Transparencia) sujetando a las Cámaras a la obligación de publicar determinados contenidos.   4. Aplicación de la reforma constitucional que obligó a diputados y senadores a declarar intereses y patrimonio en forma pública, así como a delegar a terceros la administración de bienes y obligaciones que supongan conflictos de interés, o a enajenarlos en todo o parte.  5. Regulación en su Ley Orgánica Constitucional de la publicidad de las Comisiones de Ética y Transparencia de cada Cámara y de la obligación de declarar el patrimonio.  6. Inclusión en la Ley que regula el lobby y las gestiones que representen intereses particulares antes las autoridades y funcionarios, sometiendo a sus disposiciones a diputados y senadores y personal que señala.  7.
