There are two main projects in the parliament – one is a new portal for all the Knesset committees that will present all the information regarding meetings, protocols, agendas, resolutions and more in a new and open way. The second is the establishment of the Legislation database that will include all the information regarding the laws of Israel, including all relevant materials – versions of the bills, protocols of committees and plenum. First stages of these projects are intended to be on air in the near future.  ",2 representatives of the Knesset took part in the OGP conference that was in London in October 2013 from the legal department and the information division of the Knesset.
